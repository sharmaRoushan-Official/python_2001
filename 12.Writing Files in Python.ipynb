    " * __To write to a file in Python, you follow these steps.__\n",
    " * __First, Open the text for writing (or appending) using open functions.__\n",
    " * __Second, Write to the file using the write() or writelines() method.__\n",
    " * __Third, close the file using close() method.__\n",

    "# Some Characters and their functions.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __r ----------> Open file for reading only. Starts reading from the beginning of the file.This is default mode.__\n",
    " * __rb ---------> Open file for reading only in binary format.Starts reading from the beginning of the file.__\n",
    " * __r+ ---------> Open file for reading and writing. File pointer placed at beginning of the file.__\n",
    " * __w-----------> Open file for writing only. File pointer placed at beginning of the file. Overwrites existing file and creates a new one if it does not exists.__\n",
    " * __wb----------> Same as dw but opens in binary mode.__\n",
    " * __wb+---------> Same as wb but also allows to read from the file.__\n",
    " * __a-----------> Open a file for appending. Starts writing at the end of the file. Creates a new file if file does not exists.__\n",
    " * __ab----------> Same as a but in binary format. Creates a new file if file does not exists.__\n",
    " * __a+----------> Same as a but also open for reading.__\n",
    " * __ab+---------> Same as ab but also open for reading.__"
