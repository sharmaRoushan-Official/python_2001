Early life and background
Shahid Kapoor was born in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem.[1][2] On his mother's side, he is related to filmmaker Khwaja Ahmad Abbas.[3] His parents divorced when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents.[4][5] His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: "He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk to me about Dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me."[4] His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday.[4] When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress.[4]

In Mumbai, Azeem went on to marry the actor Rajesh Khattar.[5] Kapoor continued living with his mother and Khattar, until they separated in 2001.[5] Kapoor continues to use the last name Khattar on his passport.[6] He has a maternal half-brother, Ishaan, from his mother's marriage to Khattar.[5] From his father's marriage to Pathak, he has two paternal half-siblings, Sanah and Ruhaan.[7] Kapoor was educated at the Gyan Bharati School in Delhi and Rajhans Vidyalaya in Mumbai.[8] He later attended Mumbai's Mithibai College for three years.[9]

Kapoor was interested in dance from an early age, and at the age of 15, he joined Shiamak Davar's dance institute.[10] As a student there, Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in the films Dil To Pagal Hai (1997) and Taal (1999), in which Davar served as choreographer.[10] During a stage show at the institute, Kapoor performed in the songs "Vogue" and "GoldenEye" to a positive response from the audience; he described the experience as the first time that he "felt like a star".[10] He later became an instructor at the institute.[10] During this time, Kapoor accompanied a friend to an audition for a Pepsi commercial featuring the stars Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerji, but wound up with the part himself.[4] He appeared in television commercials for the brands Kit Kat and Close-Up, among others, and featured in music videos for several performers, including the band Aryans and the singer Kumar Sanu.[11] Kapoor also took on the job of an assistant director to his father on the 1998 television series Mohandas B.A.L.L.B.
